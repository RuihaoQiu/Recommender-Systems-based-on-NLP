## Job Title Recommender

This system attempts to help the users to realize that there are more options about their position title.

### Job title autocomplete
The first function should also be the autocomplete as I described in the previous chapter. We had make a lot of efforts to build a standard job title catalogue that provide us about 10k standard job titles from our global labor market database. The difference from the location autocomplete is the ranking algorithm part. The ranking score can be simply the popularity of job title, the logic behind it is also simple, recommend the most popular job title depends on input of the user.

### Recommend title by similarity
One user might not have only one job title, for example my job title can be data scientist, machine learning engineer, artificial intelligence expert, or something I did not realize. Then this recommender can help me to find out at what positions I can put myself.
