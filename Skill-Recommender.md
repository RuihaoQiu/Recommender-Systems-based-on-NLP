## Skill Recommender
No we are going recommend skills for users. This function is to help the users to have his own full skillset. Most of the users know some of their skills, but they might neglect some important/in-demand skills, or they might also want to know what skills to develop in order to keep competitive. Our users just need to input a few skills then the App will keep recommending most relevant skills, he/she just need to select from them. This largely improves the user's experience.
